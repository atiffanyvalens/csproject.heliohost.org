	<p>Whether you’re going doing the shore or riding the waves in Hawaii, the beach is always a popular destination. 
	Take a tour of the top 10 beaches in the US.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-1.png"/>  Manele Bay, Hawaii </h3>
	<p>Hulopo'e Beach on the island of Lana'i, long considered one of the world's most perfect stretches of sand, 
	lies at the base of the Four Seasons Lana'i at Manele Bay. The resort overlooks the bay, a designated marine 
	preserve filled with colorful fish and the occasional spinner dolphin. In fact, snorkeling and diving spots 
	here are considered some of the finest in Hawaii, making a swim in the 70-degree water all the more tempting.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-2.png"/>Myrtle Beach, South Carolina</h3>
	<p>As the largest resort along South Carolina's 60-mile Grand Strand, Myrtle Beach is the East Coast's 
	ultimate vacation hub. The town teems with summertime action: beaches dotting the Strand, amusement 
	and water parks, restaurants and live entertainment. Myrtle Beach's actual beach is an extensive 
	stretch of silky white sand, with opportunities for fishing, swimming, sunbathing, sailing and surfing.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-3.png"/>Nantucket, Massachusetts</h3>
	<p>A trip to Nantucket is like visiting a faraway fairytale land -- one set against a bright blue 
	backdrop of ocean and bay in a community of simple, weathered white cottages surrounded by wild roses. 
	This former whaling community has quaint neighborhoods and a beach for everyone, including Surfside 
	Beach and Children's Beach, both of which feature calm waters and no shortage of sandcastles.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-4.png"/>Kauna'oa Bay, Hawaii</h3>
	<p>Picture Hawaii and you're probably conjuring images of Kauna'oa Bay without even realizing it. 
	Located on the Kohala Coast of the Aloha-state's Big Island, Kauna'oa Bay is quintessential, 
	picture-postcard Hawaii. With its abundant white sand, palm trees and clear, calm blue water, 
	the crescent-shaped beach is a natural draw for sun worshipers, water sport enthusiasts 
	and families in search of safe, sandy fun.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-5.png"/>Clearwater Beach, Florida</h3>
	<p>Clearwater Beach has lured countless families and couples to its broad, 
	sandy shores and beachfront hotels. Spread along a narrow, 3-mile stretch of 
	the Pinellas Peninsula on the Gulf Coast, Clearwater Beach straddles the blue 
	waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the west, and tranquil Tampa Bay to the east. 
	Visitors enjoy sunbathing on white sandy beaches, diving into a game of beach 
	volleyball, renting fishing boats, taking a dolphin-watching cruise, parasailing 
	or heading to a mainland museum or aquarium.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-6.png"/>Coronado, California</h3>
	<p>Coronado Central Beach, stretches 1.5 miles behind the great houses along Ocean Boulevard 
	in front of the glamorous Hotel Del Coronado. Swimmers, bodysurfers, boogie boarders, 
	sand sculptors, tide poolers and, from December through February, whale watchers 
	all take to the sand and sea. North Beach attracts surfers in the morning, and 
	at the extreme north is Dog Beach, where leashless canines can frolic in the surf.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-7.png"/>Cape May, New Jersey</h3>
	<p>As the farthest point south on the Shore, Cape May is the crown jewel of the region 
	with gorgeous beaches and a quaint town center filled with gingerbread Victorians 
	and colorful bed and breakfasts. Bring your binoculars to the beach to spy the 
	playful dolphins jumping in the wake.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-8.png"/>Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts</h3>
	<p>As summer commences, crowds swarm Martha's Vineyard in droves, but respite can be 
	found in the Vineyard's far eastern reaches -- up-island, as it's known locally -- 
	at Moshup Beach. Tucked beneath the infamous Gay Head Cliffs, Moshup Beach is an 
	unspoiled paradise of soft, white sand framed by red, brown and tan striated cliffs 
	looming from above.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-9.png"/>East Hampton, New York</h3>
	<p>Strolling along the broad stretches of white sand, listening to roaring waves and 
	passing the glorious mansions of Lily Pond, it's easy to see why East Hampton is a 
	beloved New York destination any time of year. The picturesque town is a favorite 
	with A-listers, and at the end of Main Street ,past sprawling yards and fences 
	surrounding huge homes, is Main Beach, where perfect white beaches and incredibly 
	tasty lobster rolls await.</p>

	<h3><img src="bg-10.png"/>Cape Hatteras National Seashore, North Carolina</h3>
	<p>Stretching for 72 miles along the Atlantic coast on the Outer Banks, 
	the Cape Hatteras National Seashore is a skinny strip of barrier islands 
	from Nags Head to Ocracoke Island. The beach’s hallmark high, sandy dunes 
	front frothy surf perfect for swimming, beachcombing and body-surfing. 
	Visitors can climb up 248 steps to the top of the nation's tallest 
	lighthouse -- towering at an impressive 196 feet -- for a spectacular 
	view of the seashore.</p>
