	<header><h1>The Top 10 Ski Resorts in the United States for 2013</h1></header>
	<p>Rankings have become so ubiquitous in our world – top colleges, top cities, top jobs, top sandwiches 
	– that they’ve begun to lose value.  Everybody has a ranking about everything.  Making matters more confusing, 
	most rankings get so granular that nearly every person, place and thing is ranked No. 1 for something.</p>
	
	<p>In the ski world, there’s been a bit of this specialization ranking creeping in as well.  To be sure,
	some of it is fair.  Winter Park, for instance, can’t compare its terrain to that of Snowbird, but the Colorado
	resort does offer some of the greatest access to disabled and adaptive skiers in the world – and it deserves 
	credit for that.  Other outlets rank snow, grooming, family friendliness, food, lodging, customer service and 
	even the quality of the booze on mountain.</p>

	<p>All of those things matter to somebody.  But here we only rank one thing: Awesomeness.  It’s the most important
	thing we can measure.  If you can know a place’s awesomeness, do you need to know anything else?</p>

	<p>Answer: No.</p>

	<p>We measure awesomeness with strict adherence to quantitative and scientific methods.  The rankings you see 
	here are the product of the most honed algorithms ever unleashed on the ski world.  Being on this list means 
	something.  It means awesomeness.  We don’t rank 50 resorts, we rank only ten — and we’ve included extended 
	and 100% new material on the top six.</p>

	<p>Wear a helmet: The home to Corbet's Couloir retained it's No. 1 ranking for 2013. There’s nothing east 
	of the Rockies on the list because no resort east of the Rockies has the snow or terrain to crack our awesomeness 
	rankings–something that matters for both beginners and experts (soft western snow >> eastern ice). Not that 
	there isn’t fun to be had in the East or even the Midwest.  Ski wherever you can.  We plan to do a separate, 
	eastern list next year.</p>

	<p>Again, we rank awesomeness and awesomeness only.  If you want to find out what ski resort has the best hot
	chocolate and marshmallow bar, you’ll find that list elsewhere.  If you want the hard facts on what ski 
	mountain gives you the best possibility of a soul-moving experience on and off the snow, then you need 
	rankings based on our patented Pure Awesomeness Factor.  In the ski business, this is known as PAF. 
	It’s not something that resorts make public, but every mountain knows where it stands.  Most big resorts 
	employ at least three data scientists who spend their days looking for methods to raise the resort’s PAF score.</p>

	<p>Awesomeness is the only proxy for awesomeness.  It’s the critical path to a vacation that becomes legendary.
	So for the second time ever, here are the top ten resorts in the United States according to PAF:</p>
	
	<h3>1.  Jackson Hole, Wyoming (PAF = 98.5):</h3>
	<figure><img src="Jackson_Hole.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>Everything is big--and awesome--at Jackson Hole.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>The lift lines at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort are like those at a highway rest area bathroom at 2:00 a.m.: 
	Almost nonexistent, except when they exist.  And just like that line at the bathroom, if a queue has grown 
	large at Jackson Hole, then there is probably a great reason to get in it immediately.</p>

	<p>One of the few spots where lines used to bubble up at Jackson was at the Thunder chairlift, which gets skiers 
	to the hairier southern side of the resort.  On a powder day, Thunder was to be avoided; you planned your 
	morning around it.  JHMR is a place run by skiers and they were more than aware of the choke point Thunder created.</p>

	<p>So before last season, the people in charge installed a new chairlift, Marmot, whose base sits adjacent to that of Thunder’s.
	It functions as a pressure-release valve for Thunder and provides the dual purpose of getting skiers back to the top of the 
	Bridger Gondola for a snack or lunch without forcing them to ski to the bottom of this very tall mountain.  One medium-sized
	lift, one huge improvement.</p>

	<p>All of the other things that made Jackson No. 1 in last year’s rankings remain true.  It’s still the best skiing mountain 
	in North America.  It still has the best continuous fall line, the best terrain and the best backcountry of any mountain 
	not in the Himalayas. And there’s that $30-million ascending jam fest of music, sweat and rollicking cheers, 
	also known as The Tram, which offers the best return on 10 minutes of standing that you’ll ever be offered (all 4,139 
	feet of vertical, at once).</p>

	<p>Jackson gets extra points for coming through with decent snow last winter (the winter that wasn’t) when most of the 
	country’s ski resorts were still putting up with random patches of brown grass on January 15.  And it never hurts to 
	have the most famous ski run in the world – Corbet’s Couloir – inside the boundaries.</p>


	<p>On top of skiing, Jackson has come into its own as a culinary destination, a nifty feat for a place so small and thinly 
	populated. The area is awash in new and creative eateries: Roadhouse Brewing Co., the Handle Bar at the Four Season 
	(a Michael Mina concept), a great contemporary  spot in town in The Kitchen, and the reincarnation of a longtime local 
	favorite, Billy’s Burgers. On the mountain, don’t miss waffles stuffed with Nutella and bananas at Corbet’s Cabin.</p>	


	<p>A minor gripe on the foot front (very minor): one of this column’s favorite restaurants in Jackson, Trio, made
	the mistake last winter of messing with one of the best burgers in America when it switched its meat patty from
	local bison to ho-hum angus beef.  It remains a fine burger, but it no longer stands out from stalwarts in New York
	and Chicago.</p>

	<p>No time to eat?  You can still have it all: Stuff your pockets with Tram Bars, the most delicious energy bar in 
	the world, sold all over at Jackson Hole and made just over the ridge in Victor, Idaho. </p>
	
	
	<h3>2. Alta and Snowbird, Utah (PAF = 97):</h3>
	<figure><img src="alta.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>Snowbird: Best snow, epic terrain, epic lift.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>For most people, these two resorts that occupy a splendid apron of Little Cottonwood Canyon just 
	35 minutes from downtown Salt Lake should be the default ski vacation. Direct flights to Salt Lake can be
	had from most cities and the trip from the airport to the snow here is a leisurely stroll compared with the
	white-knuckle pilgrimage between Denver and Colorado’s resorts. </p>

	<p>We rank Snowbird and Alta together because they are together.  They share a boundary line and even, for
	those who choose to purchase it, a joint lift ticket.  If you go to one, you should go to the other.  
	Unless you’re a snowboarder, in which case Alta won’t allow you to plow through its chutes and trees—and
	what glorious chutes and trees they are. </p>

	<p>The terrain at Alta and Snowbird is the terrain against which all others are measured.  Snowbird’s tram,
	which, like Jackson’s, also traverses from the base of the resort to the top, is the only lift that compares 
	with the tram at Jackson Hole. The lift line for the Snowbird tram on a prime powder day can get ugly—one of 
	the drawbacks of being on top of a greater metropolitan area of 2 million people. </p>

	<p>The good news is that not all of those people ski and, even better, this place has a lot of powder days—it gets 600 
	inches a year—more than anywhere outside of Alaska.  The snow is dependable and comes in a density that’s user friendly,
	like a stiff dollop of whipped milk on a cappuccino.  If you’re going on a trip for three days or less, it’s hard to go 
	anywhere but Utah. We can’t stress enough how awesome the skiing is here.  If you haven’t been, just go. </p>

	<p>Not to be missed: Snowbird’s Cliff Lodge, a wonderful modern building whose raw, reinforced concrete edifice 
	evokes the work of architect Paul Rudolph, a brilliant shaper of glass and poured stone. </p>
	
	
	<h3> 3. Telluride, Colorado (PAF = 90):</h3>
	<figure><img src="telluride.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>The marriage between town and mountain in Telluride is unique.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>There isn’t a more charming notch in the Rocky Mountains than the perfect box canyon that Telluride inhabits.  The nearby 
	peaks’ proximity makes the town feel more like the Alps than another Colorado ski town. The closeness of the mountains 
	also makes for some chilly mornings, as it can be past brunch hour by the time sunlight hits Colorado Avenue, Telluride’s 
	main street.  But that’s a small nit when it comes to one of the America’s best ski towns. </p>

	<p>The gondola is a centerpiece of living in or visiting Telluride. It’s free for everybody and runs from 7 a.m. to midnight, 
	giving both town and Mountain Village dwellers easy access to restaurants, bars and shops on either end of town or the resort.
	 </p>
	
	<p>The skiing at Telluride is good and continues to get better.  The fall lines are extended and true and the peaks in the near
	distance are 14,000-footers. Newer terrain on the backside in Revelation Bowl gives the resort a true Western snowfield 
	experience and there are abundant chutes and hike-to steeps, some of which are accessed by the coolest steps not on the 
	Vallée Blanche: the Gold Hill Chutes Staircase. </p>

	<p>For this coming winter, in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service, Telluride gladed some pine stands along the Palmyra 
	Express lift as well as next to the Plunge lift.  The thinning removed down and dead trees, giving skiers better paths in
	the woods as well as getting more light and water to healthy trees, leading to a more robust forest overall. Telluride also has 
	further expanded its boundaries above the treeline to include more of the north side of Bald Mountain.  The resulting new run 
	is temporarily called Bald 6.  Ski it, own it… maybe they’ll name it after you. </p>

	<p>Telluride’s dining options are commensurate with the kind of wealth that has concentrated on its streets and slopes during the
	last 20 years.  La Marmotte, in old town inside a 100-year old building near the base of the gondola, is a classic.  Get the 
	tasting menu with the short ribs. Two new foodie standouts on the mountain for this season: Bon Vivant and Tomboy Tavern. </p>

	<p>Welcome to Flavor-Town (the better-than Guy Fieri version): Try the breakfast burrito at The Butcher & Baker Cafe, a gem of a
	spot on Colorado Ave.  Includes: sweet potatoes, tomatoes, beans and eggs, and sausage if you want it. </p>

	<p>Double Bonus time: Telluride has the nicest restrooms in the ski world – the resort actually uses the word “dominate” when 
	comparing their bathrooms to those at other mountains.  So go ahead and dominate a pile of jalapenos on your chili bowl — with
	a heart empty of fear. </p>
	
	<h3>4. Vail, Colorado (PAF = 87):</h3>
	<figure><img src="vail.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>Vail offers the best skiing on Colorado's I-70 corridor.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	
	<p><i>Vail moved up this year from No. 5 thanks to lift and technology improvements on the mountain. </i></p>
	<p>There’s nothing in the U.S. so big as Vail’s 5,289 acres.  Vail is a megaresort; there’s no getting around this fact. 
	Not only is it big, but it’s popular.  You will see crowds here that are impossible anywhere else.</p>

	<p>But as it turns out, James Surowiecki’s hypothesis regarding crowds is quite accurate when it comes to Vail: there’s a
	good reason all these people show up.  The terrain at Vail is the best and broadest of any of the central Colorado resorts.
	It also benefits from being on the west side of Vail pass, which results in more snow compared with resorts on the east side
	of the pass (Copper, Keystone, Breckenridge).</p>

	<p>Some of the biggest problems at Vail—long lines and bottlenecks—have been mitigated during the last two years.  If you ever 
	remember waiting for two hours at the bottom of Chair No. 5 to get a ride off of the backside of the mountain, you needn’t 
	fear such a fate again. Vail pulled that slow double chair out and installed a high-speed quad, which means things might 
	get skied off faster back there, but at least, if you’re hustling, you stand a chance at three or four runs of face shots
	rather than just one—and that’s all you can ask for.</p>

	<p>The crush at the bottom of the resort on busy days—when more than 20,000 people can be on the mountain—has been relieved
	by a new gondola that goes through Vail Village to Vail Mountain.  The new lift takes 10-passengers per cabin and treats 
	riders with Wifi and heat.  No word yet if they’ll let you ride around and around without getting off.</p>

	<p>Technology further enhances the on-mountain experience at Vail through its industry-leading EpicMix app for iPhones and 
	Android devices. Once installed, the app tracks riders’ vertical feet skied. Volleys of bragging are easily disseminated 
	to jealous friends and family through the app’s Facebook integration.  More than 40,000 people downloaded the app last year,
	which lead to 275,000 Facebook postings.</p>

	<p>We’d be remiss to not mention Vail’s sister resort, Beaver Creek, in this spot as well. The mountains don’t touch each
	other like Alta-Snowbird or Park City-Deer Valley, but they share parent companies, lift tickets and the same snowfall profile
	—and they’re only 20 minutes apart from each other.  Beaver Creek, still one of the youngest ski resorts in the U.S. at 32 
	years old, was created to spar with the fanciest of the fancy: Utah’s Deer Valley, Idaho’s Sun Valley and Aspen Mountain—and
	it’s succeeded at that.</p>

	<p>Beaver Creek’s lift network is comfy and thorough—and lines are well controlled, especially away from the mountain’s base.  
	There’s a quantity of sneaky-good terrain at the Beav as well; don’t miss the chance to test your edges on Birds of Prey,
	one of the more fearsome downhill courses on the World Cup. The top of the course is often studded with moguls, but some
	skiers can catch it groomed, slick and nasty—just like the World Cuppers like it. As you throw turns every 10 feet to
	control your speed at the top of the course, imagine straight-lining the whole stretch.  Then keep turning—all the way 
	to a warm, free chocolate-chip cookie at the bottom, a Beaver Creek specialty.</p>
	
	<h3>5. Park City, Deer Valley and The Canyons – Utah (PAF = 86):</h3>
	<figure><img src="park-city.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>Park City's town lift.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>This list is about ranking the best places to go skiing.  Park City is most certainly one of those places — and it 
	happens to be a place with three mountains.  These are separate resorts, but they’re all within 10 minutes of each other
	(Park City Mountain Resort and Deer Valley actually share a boundary line) and taking a trip to one usually means taking 
	a trip to the other.  Together these mountains surround the old mining town of Park City, Utah, which every January is 
	also home to the Sundance Film Festival.</p>

	<p>First, let’s tackle the town, then we’ll talk about the skiing. Park City the town has more to offer than perhaps any 
	other mountain town going. It’s bigger than Telluride, more accessible than Aspen, only 35 minutes from a major airport
	and the place is picture perfect in every sense.  Plus there is a ski run that runs right down to Main Street, serviced 
	by the Town Lift, which carries you back up to the slopes of Park City Mountain Resort.  A good evening routine: hit up the
	No Name Saloon (locals still call it “the ‘Mo,” short for the bar’s old Alamo moniker) for a 24 oz. mug of Uinta  Brewing’s
	Cutthroat Pale Ale and then wander down to Park Avenue to Davanza’s  and grab a chicken-and-jalapeno pizza 0r a chicken parm
	sandwich.  If you’re feeling flusher, stay on Main Street and hit Zoom, Robert Redford’s restaurant that does a great job 
	with local fare.</p>

	<p>As for skiing, the best lift in town is The Canyon’s 9990.  At the very top of the resort, 9990 offers some hearty steep 
	fall lines and a big north-facing slope that stays cold and dry even in the late spring.  A little hard work here usually 
	yields some powder that tourists couldn’t find.  The Canyons also employs the best lift operators anywhere – this is a fact.
	The Canyons spans 4,000 skiable acres, making it the biggest resort in Utah.  The resort is quite spread out, however, and
	a lot of time can be wasted trying to get from one end to the other.  Skiers should pick a side and mine it.</p>

	<p>Deer Valley, the place where Mitt Romney skis, is as fancy as you might think.  But it also packs in some great shots of
	terrain, including the Daly chutes, which are accessed from the Empire Canyon lift.  At the bottom of that lift, at Empire
	Canyon Lodge, skiers will find not only the greatest ski lodge in the world, but also the greatest single dish served 
	mountainside anywhere: Deer Valley’s Turkey Chili.  At less than $10, this mix of cumin, coriander, corn, black beans 
	and big turkey pieces is an edible bargain at a place known for its bling.  All of the food at Deer Valley, in fact, 
	is excellent — and no more expensive than food across the rest of the ski world.</p>

	<p>Powder lasts a little longer at Deer Valley than other places.  Some of the best bets for long, lonely runs of untracked
	are some of the older, sleepier trails on the east-facing slope of Bald Mountain that are served by the Mayflower lift. 
	Hit it early and hit it hard. Unless you’re a snowboarder.  Then, like with Alta, you won’t be hitting it at all.</p>

	<p>Park City Mountain Resort is interesting because it backs right up to Main Street. The Town Lift is almost worth a lift 
	ticket by itself.  But we rank it third among the three Park City resorts for its abundance of time-wasting run-outs, lack 
	of continuous fall lines and, for Utah, something of a crowd problem.  The best spots on the mountain are those accessed by
	Jupiter chairlift.  There are some hikes that get skiers bigger shots and some of the terrain to the far skiers’ right is 
	legitimately excellent.  There’s enough here to keep good skiers interested, but we don’t recommend straying far from Jupiter.</p>

	<p>Get it while it’s fresh: On a snowing powder day, make for Deer Valley’s trees while the rich folk play bridge and the locals
	pound The Canyons and PCMR.</p>

	<p>For a change: If you’re at PCMR, ski down to Main Street for an uncrowded lunch and drink a coffee to-go while you ride the
	Town Lift back to the snow.</p>
	
	<h3>6. Squaw Valley / Alpine Meadows (PAF = 84):</h3>
	<figure><img src="alpine.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>Alpine Meadows and Squaw Valley offer unique vistas.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p><i>Squaw and Alpine dropped two spots in our rankings because of the
	combined ranking of the Park City resorts, our first time doing that, and the improved 
	score of Vail.</i></p>
	
	<p>Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows didn’t do anything wrong last season, but they were punished by the snow 
	spirits as the place was bereft of a real snow base through January.  At that point, half of the high season was over.</p>

		<p>We can’t reasonably hold such a thing against the resorts, although it might be wise on their part to file a 
	complaint with the Department of Global Warming Problems.  The snow patterns are already mercurial around Lake Tahoe
	—evinced by the record 700 inches that fell during the winter of 2010-2011 and the utter dud of last winter—the place
	doesn’t need something else adding more unpredictability.</p>

		<p>That said, these two resorts, now linked by a joint ownership agreement and a speedy 10-minute shuttle system called 
	the Squaw-Alpine Express, share lift tickets, season passes and the best terrain in the Sierras.  The joining is
	an excellent deal for California skiers—something that was done to compete with Vail Resort’s Epic Pass, the best deal 
	in skiing. (Vail owns three Tahoe-area resorts — Heavenly, Northstar and Kirkwood — that are included on the Epic Pass.)</p>

	<p>The SquawAlpine megaplex has been aggressively updating its base areas, with plans to spend $50 million over 5 years
	adding restaurants, bars and all the fixins that go with big boy resorts.  For people who find that their ski-charging
	caffeine is better served in coffee than in a can of Red Bull, Squaw has a treat for you this winter: the first ever 
	ski-in, ski-out Starbucks. It will be located at mid mountain.</p>

		<p>On to the important stuff, skiing:  As always, if you hit Squaw/Alpine with the right conditions, there are few places 
	with comparable terrain.  There’s a reason that many of the world’s best extreme skiers are bred on these lifts. 
	Squaw sports one of the few true mountain trams in the United States (Jackson Hole, Snowbird, Big Sky, Jay Peak) 
	and the only U.S. funitel, a high speed gondola that runs on two wires, which allows it to continue operations in 
	rougher weather and when wind events kick up, as they often do in the Sierra.  For this year, Squaw has installed
	a new high-speed six-pack lift (they’ll fill all of those seats on Saturdays) that will get people to Shirley Lake 
	and Granite Chief’s chutes and trees all the quicker.</p>

		<p>Because we find it bizarre and fun every time we mention it: Squaw Valley hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2>Spots No. 7 – No. 10</h2>
	<h3>Silverton Mountain (PAF: NA)</h3>
	<figure><img src="silverton.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>Silverton: holy ground</figcaption>
	</figure>
		<p>Silverton’s PAF score is, in fact, off of the charts.  
		<a href="wwww.forbes.com/forbes/2005/1017/131.html">We covered it in the magazine here.</a>   
	It’s a mountain only fit for expert skiers and people who are comfortable with the spartan 
	amenities of an outhouse and a yurt with a keg on wheels.  We’re good with that.  Very good.  
	Silverton isn’t a destination resort, which is why its PAF score doesn’t calculate, but it’s 
	most certainly a destination.</p>
	
	<h3>Brighton/Solitude (PAF: 83) </h3>
	<figure><img src="solitude.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>Solitude has world-class trees and snow.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	 	<p>These side-by-side Utah mountains are the light versions of Alta-Snowbird.  They’re one ridge 
	 north, in Big Cottonwood Canyon rather than Little Cottonwood Canyon, but they get the same 
	 copious snow that annually buries Alta and Snowbird.  Solitude and Brighton aren’t as vertical, 
	 but there are lots of spots, especially at Solitude, worth an expert’s time.  And the best part 
	 about these two mountains: they’re remarkably uncrowded.</p>
	
	<h3>Big Sky (PAF: 81)</h3>
	<figure><img src="big-sky.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>Big Sky delivers on its moniker.</figcaption>
	</figure>
		<p>Montana skiing doesn’t get the love it deserves.  We’re going to change that soon.  Big Sky has
	some great terrain, but it loses points on accessibility (you have to fly to Bozeman) and the 
	fact that the place is always cold and has a weaker base village.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Wolf Creek (PAF: 80)</h3>
	<figure><img src="wolf-creek.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>Wolf Creek: Snow to the roof... and green chiles.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>This Southwest Colorado resort, if it had more vertical and steeps, would be one of the legendary 
	ski destinations in the world.  It’s still a great spot as it is and it receives the best snow
	in all of Colorado by a big margin.  The powder can last because this place is hard to reach.  
	At the base, don’t miss the green chili, made with local green chiles.</p>
	
	<h3>A-Basin (PAF: 80)</h3>
	<figure><img src="a-basin.jpg"/> 
	<figcaption>A-Basin: Steepest spot in central Colorado</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>A poor man’s Alta (except snowboarders are allowed here), parking lot barbecues serve up more
	collective protein here than do the restaurants on the mountain.  A-Basin is the spot where 
	gritty central Colorado skiers gather to ski legitimate steeps and epic lines on a powder day.</p>
