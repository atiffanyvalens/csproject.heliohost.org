	<h1>10 Beautiful Mountains in America</h1>
	<h3>Stunning natural masterpieces from Alaska to Maine</h3>

	<section>
	<h3>1. Mount Whitney, California</h3><img src="mount-whitney.jpg"/> 
	<p>At 14,505 feet — the highest point in the Lower 48 — this granite beauty is surprisingly 
	easy to climb. Hikers in good shape can make the 22-mile round-trip trek to the summit 
	and back in a single (albeit long) day. The payoff is fantastic views that include the 
	lowest place in the United States: Death Valley.</p>

	<h3>2. Maroon Bells, Colorado</h3><img src="maroon-bells.jpg"/> 
	<p>With their almost vertical faces reflected in mirrorlike Maroon Lake, these three triangular 
	peaks (14,163 feet at their highest point) near Aspen are probably more photographed 
	than any other scene in Colorado. Visit the region for alpine wildflowers in summer 
	and golden trees in fall. In winter, don snowshoes or cross-country skis to take 
in the quiet beauty of the landscape.</p>

	<h3>3. Mount Shasta, California</h3><img src="mount-shasta.jpg"/> 
	<p>From the flat plain of California's Upper Sacramento Valley soars this 14,179-foot 
	behemoth, a perennially snowcapped volcano that last erupted in 1786. The mountain 
	is a popular challenge for beginning climbers and a magnet for spiritual seekers 
	(you can tap into the scene in the New Age-y town of Mount Shasta).</p>

	<h3>4. Mount Timpanogos, Utah</h3><img src="timpanogos.jpg"/> 
	<p>Fondly referred to as "Timp" by locals, this 11,750-foot peak is Utah's second highest. 
	The mountain's history is cloaked in Native American legends, including one that 
	has the hearts of two ill-fated lovers bound into a single Great Heart — a large stalactite 
	in one of the mountain's impressive limestone caves.</p>

	<h3>5. Mount Rainier, Washington</h3><img src="rainier.jpg"/> 
	<p>East of Seattle, this enormous volcano hovers like a snowcapped totem. In summer, 
	Mount Rainier National Park is popular for its alpine wildflowers, with aptly 
	named Paradise being one of the best spots for blooms. Mountaineers also take 
	on the 14,410-foot peak, testing their ice-climbing skills on its glaciers.</p>

	<h3>6. Mount Katahdin, Maine</h3><img src="katahdin.jpg"/> 
	<p>This 5,269-foot mountain might not be the precise spot where the sun first 
	hits the country in the morning, but it sure feels like it. The glaciated, 
	granite peak — rising above a surrounding so remote it's sometimes referred 
	to as the 51st state — is the perfect place to catch the day's first light.</p>

	<h3>7. Grand Teton, Wyoming</h3><img src="mount-mckinley.jpg"/> 
	<p>Dramatic, unforgettable, wild — this snaggletoothed peak is everything a mountain should be. 
	It's justly on the bucket list of many mountaineers, who must tackle rock, ice and snow to 
	reach the 13,770-foot summit. Some even take on the ultimate challenge: hauling up skis so 
	they can schuss their way back down.</p>

	<h3>8. Wheeler Peak, Nevada</h3><img src="wheeler-peak.jpg"/> 
	<p>This wild and remote 13,065-foot jaw-dropper is the signature mountain in 125,000-acre 
	Great Basin National Park. Wind your way into the clouds on the spectacular Wheeler Peak 
	Scenic Drive, a paved (thankfully) 12-mile route that corkscrews up to spots with 
	unforgettable desert vistas.</p>

	<h3>9. Mauna Loa, Hawaii</h3><img src="mauna-loa.jpg"/> 
	<p>This Big Island beast of a mountain, the world's largest volcano, tops out at 13,677 feet. 
	That's impressive enough, yet geologists estimate Mauna Loa's true height, measured 
	from the depression its mass forms in the Earth's crust, is a staggering 56,000 feet 
	total, or 5 miles taller than Mount Everest. And it's still growing, its crimson lava 
	visible today within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.</p>

	<h3>10. Mount McKinley, Alaska</h3><img src="mount-whitney.jpg"/> 
	<p>Whether you call it by its modern moniker or by its native Athabascan Indian name, 
	Denali, meaning "Great One," this 20,320-foot geologic masterpiece, North America's 
	tallest mountain, creates an unforgettable silhouette in the Alaskan sky. Protected 
	as part of 6 million acres of national park, it's a land of snow and ice, braided 
	glacial rivers and incredible wildlife.</p>
